## What's Different from Finder?

| Feature | Finder | Folder |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Keyboard navigation | Limited | Full arrow key support |
| Search results | No drag & drop | Drag & drop enabled |
| External drives | Hidden in sidebar | Auto-detected, one-click eject |
| Window management | Multiple windows | Single focused window |
| Performance | Slow with large folders | Cached icons, instant updates |
| Customization | Limited | Grid size, themes, hide/show sections |

## Settings

Press **Cmd+,** to customize:
- Default view mode (Grid or List)
- Icon size (40-200px)
- Show/hide hidden files
- Toggle sidebar sections
- Theme (Light/Dark/System)

## Troubleshooting

**App won't open?** Remove quarantine:
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Folder.app
```

**Build errors?** Clean and rebuild:
```bash
rm -rf .build Folder.app && ./build.sh
```

**Permissions prompts?** Grant file access on first launch. Folder uses security-scoped bookmarks to remember your choices.
